# Module 3: Keyword Search First — The Critical Foundation

> **The 90% Problem:** Most RAG systems jump straight to vector search and miss the foundation that powers the best retrieval systems. This module does it right.

This folder contains the materials for Module 3 of Falco, where we implement the **keyword search foundation** that professional RAG systems rely on using OpenSearch and BM25 scoring.

## Why Keyword Search First?

**The Professional Path:** Unlike simple implementations that jump straight to vector embeddings, this system builds the foundation that successful companies use:

1. **Exact Match Power:** Keywords excel at finding specific technical terms, paper IDs, and precise phrases
2. **Interpretable Results:** You can understand exactly why a paper was retrieved 
3. **Speed & Efficiency:** BM25 is computationally fast and doesn't require expensive embedding models
4. **Production Reality:** Companies like Elasticsearch, Algolia, and enterprise search use keyword search as their foundation

**The Implementation Path:**
```
Module 3: Master BM25 keyword search    ← YOU ARE HERE
Module 4: Add intelligent chunking
Module 5: Introduce vector embeddings for hybrid retrieval  
Module 6: Optimize the complete system
```

## Before You Start

**Essential Environment Setup:**
```bash
# 1. Ensure you have the correct environment configuration
cp .env.example .env

# 2. Verify OpenSearch settings are properly configured
# Your .env should contain these critical Module 3 settings:
# OPENSEARCH__HOST=http://opensearch:9200
# OPENSEARCH__INDEX_NAME=arxiv-papers
```

**Important:** Module 3 requires the `.env` file to be properly configured for OpenSearch connectivity and indexing. The defaults in `.env.example` work out of the box.

   - Bulk indexing operations with error handling and validation
   - Real-time indexing verification and performance monitoring

5. **BM25 Search Implementation**
   - Multi-field search across title, abstract, and content with field boosting
   - Advanced query features: highlighting, pagination, category filtering
   - Testing two-letter queries (AI, ML, NN, CV) as specifically requested
   - Fuzzy matching and typo tolerance configuration

6. **Search API Development**
   - FastAPI integration with OpenSearch dependency injection
   - RESTful endpoints: `GET /search` for simple queries, `POST /search` for advanced search
   - Response formatting with pagination, metadata, and highlighted snippets
   - Error handling and service health monitoring endpoints

7. **Airflow Pipeline Updates**
   - Sequential task execution: setup → fetch → opensearch → report → cleanup
   - Real OpenSearch indexing replacing placeholder operations
   - Updated daily reporting with search statistics and health metrics
   - Graceful handling of PDF processing limits (>20MB or >30 pages)

8. **End-to-End Pipeline Verification**
